## Frontend Portfolio

## Description

A well designed site for me to display my developer projects, contact details and information about myself, showcasing my front end abilities. In undertaking this task I was motivated to improve my implementation of front-end design. Undertaking this project has allowed me to build an efficent and usable resource for me to send to prospectiive employers or whomever I would like to share my achievements in programming with, as well as linking them to my github, linkedin and email. Completing this project allowed me to further develop my front-end design skills with HTML, CSS and boostrap as well as a number of js driven features.
